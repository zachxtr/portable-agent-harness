# Portable Agent Harness

> Maintained by [Data Finn](https://datafinn.com).  
> Built on **[Full CRY!](./template/myAgent/memory/full-cry-sdlc/Full_CRY_Overview.md)** — Data Finn's AI-age development methodology (see below).
> Licensed under the MIT open-source [LICENSE](./LICENSE) — the patterns and methodology are freely adaptable for other projects.

A structured **agent harness** you install into any repository so your AI coding agent keeps continuity between sessions including: persona, procedures, project memory, and methodology.

Think of it as the agent's **onboarding kit and working memory**. Without it, every session starts from zero. With it, the agent knows the project, the people, and the current state of work before the first message is sent.

---

## Methodology — Full CRY!

> **Create without fear, refactor relentlessly, yield to reality** — with aligned principles that keep the AI army pointed at the right target.

**Full CRY!** (Create → Refactor → Yield) is an AI-age development cycle: move fast with an agent army, sculpt the result into clean code, then **use the system as its first user** before stacking more work on a shaky foundation.

| Pillar | In one line |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create** | Build and experiment fast — exploration is cheap when agents can scaffold and rebuild quickly. |
| **Refactor** | Keep code clear and consistent — rename, split, and propagate until it reads like a good essay. |
| **Yield** | Run it locally, click the UI, check the data — validate before the next CREATE cycle. |

This harness encodes Full CRY! in practice: session safeguards, coding protocols in `SOUL.md`, yield checkpoints via code logs, and depth files loaded only when needed. Full treatise (aligned principles, gotchas, origin story): [Full CRY! overview](./template/myAgent/memory/full-cry-sdlc/Full_CRY_Overview.md).

## Agent Files

Each agent has five core files. Each owns a distinct scope — no overlap.

| File | Scope | Changes |
|------|-------|---------|
| `SESSION.md` | **Procedures** — session start sequence, session close checklist, and skills index. What the agent does and when. | Occasionally |
| `IDENTITY.md` | **Persona** — who the agent is. Name, role, origin story, and character. Static facts about the agent itself. | Rarely |
| `SOUL.md` | **Operating principles** — how the agent thinks and works. Core truths, development philosophy, coding protocols, and vibe. | Rarely, intentionally |
| `USER.md` | **Human profile** — who the user is. Background, working style, and preferences. | As needed |
| `MEMORY.md` | **Current state** — active project status and the authoritative map of memory files. First read every session. | Every session |

---

## Memory Files

**`MEMORY.md`** — project pickup snapshot (status, next step, topic index). **`SOUL.md`** — operating principles and pointers to methodology subfolders.

| Location | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `memory/*.md` (root) | Project topics (TODO, architecture, PA harness, WIPs) |
| `memory/full-cry-sdlc/` | **Full CRY!** methodology document in folder |
| `memory/data-experience-journey/` | Data Experience (DX) |
| `memory/.archive/` | Retired — do not reference |

Session procedures and the full harness guide: `myAgent/SESSION.md`.

---

## Skills

Reusable agent procedures live in `myAgent/skills/`. Load the relevant skill before performing any recurring task.

| Skill | Path | Use When |
|-------|------|----------|
| Code Log Entries | `skills/code-log-entries/SKILL.md` | Writing or updating the session progress log |

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zachxtr/portable-agent-harness.git
cd portable-agent-harness
./scripts/init.sh /path/to/your-project
```

- Installs to **`.agents/`** in the target repo (default agent: **`myAgent`**)
- Fails if `.agents/` already exists; use **`--force`** to overwrite
- Validates with `./scripts/validate.sh /path/to/your-project`

Non-interactive example:

```bash
PROJECT_NAME="Acme API" USER_NAME="Alex" USER_WHAT_TO_CALL="Alex" \
  ./scripts/init.sh /path/to/your-project
```

Options: `--path`, `--agent`, `--force` — see `./scripts/init.sh --help`

---

## After install

1. Open a new chat in Cursor (or your AI IDE)
2. Add `@.agents/myAgent`
3. Say: *Please load context*
